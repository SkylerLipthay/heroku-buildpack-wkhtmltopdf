It is designed to be used with [heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi) to combine it with the appropriate real buildpack for your app.

## Usage

Add a `.buildpacks` file to the root of your repo that contains this buildpack URL and your real buildpack URL:

    https://github.com/rafaelp/heroku-buildpack-wkhtmltopdf
    https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby

Then create an application using the multi buildpack:

    $ heroku create --stack cedar-14 --buildpack https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi

or configure an existing application:

    $ heroku config BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi

You can verify that everything is properly installed by running the following command:

    $ heroku run "wkhtmltopdf -V"
